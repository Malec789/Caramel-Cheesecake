To make the caramel sauce, pour the sugar into an even layer in a large saucer pan
Heat on medium-high heat, whisking the sugar until melted. The sugar will clump up first, but will eventually completely melt. This should take about 10 minutes
Once the sugar has melted, stop whisking and allow to cook until the sugar has turned to a little darker amber color. You may notice a nutty aroma. The changes in color will happen quickly, so don't let it go too long or get too dark or it will burn. Remove the caramel from the heat.
Add the butter and whisk until combined. The mixture will bubble up quite a bit, but keep whicking until all the butter has melted and combined.
Slowly pour the heavy cream into the caramel and whisk until incorporated. It hhelps to add just a bit at a time until the caramel starts to thin out, and then add the rest. Whisk until well incorporated and smooth.
Set about the 1 1/2 cups of caramel sauce aside for topping. Add the flour to the remaining caramel and set that aside.
To make the cheesecake crust, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (or 163 degrees C). Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper in the bottom and grease the sides
Combine the crust ingredients in a small bowl. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the springform pan
Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool
Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (148 degrees C)
Pour the caramel sauce with the flour into the bottom of the crust and spread into an even layer
To make the cheesecake filling, beat the cream cheese, brown sugar, and flour in a large mixer bowl on low speed until well combined and smooth. Be sure to use low speed to reduce the amount of air added to the butter, which can cause cracks. Scrape down the sides of the bowl
Add the sour cream and vanilla extract and mix on low speed until well combined
Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly to combine after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well combined
Pour the cheesecake batter into the crust, over the caramel
Bake for 1 hour 45 minutes. The center should be set, but still jiggly
Turn off the oven and leave the door closed for 30 minutes. The cheesecake will continue to cook, but slowly begin to cool as well
When the cheesecake is cool and firm, remove it from the pan and place it in the fridge until cool and firm
Prior to serving, pour 1/2 a cup of the remaining caramel sauce over the cheesecake and sprinkle it with some tofee bits
